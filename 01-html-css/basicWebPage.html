<!-- NOTE HTML Basics
    HTML is a shorthand for Hyper Text Markup Language
    All it does is semantically describes the content of the web page
-->
<!-- Let look at the barebone snippet of HTML5-->

<!-- Tells the browser that this is a html document -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- NOTE html
  This denotes the start of the HTML document -->
<html lang="en">
  <!-- NOTE head
    This is the "head" tag. It usually houses the meta, title, link and script tags -->
  <head>
    <!-- NOTE meta
      These meta tags are specific to HTML5 and we don't have to worry about them -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

    <!-- NOTE title
      The title tag defined the title of the web page, i.e., the text displayed on the
    title bar of the web browser -->
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>

  <!-- NOTE body
    The body tag holds content that is actually displayed on the web page -->
  <body>
    <!-- NOTE h1
      The H1 tag is used to write headings. There are 6 levels with 1 being the largest -->
    <h1>JavaScript is important but so is HTML and CSS</h1>

    <!-- NOTE p
      The paragraph tag is used to display content that is multiple lines long -->
    <p>
      JavaScript is one of the language that powers the world wide wed. HTML and
      CSS are vital for the development of a webpage. Where JavaScript shines is
      in the topic of DOM manipulation, i.e., the alerting of the Document
      Object Model at runtime.
    </p>

    <!-- NOTE img 
      Image tag is used to embed images onto the web page.
    Unlike the tags we previously saw it is a self closing tag and does not require a 
    seperate closing element-->
    <img src="jsHtmlCSSLogo.jpeg" alt="JavaScript CSS HTML Logo" />

    <!-- NOTE div
      The Div tag is a semantic element that generally houses a group of other logically
    related tags/elements/content.
  
    We mainly do this so that they can be easily styled and grouped together-->
    <div>
      <h1>This is another heading</h1>
      This is another paragraph with a
      <!-- NOTE a
        anchor tags are used to create hyperlinks -->
      <a href="www.google.com">link to google.com</a>
    </div>

    <!-- HTML Forms
    The form tag is one of the most important html tags to create methods of input to 
    gather data from the user-->
    <form>
      <p>Please fill in this form</p>
      <!-- NOTE input
      the input tag is concerned with accepting data from user -->
      <input type="text" placeholder="Enter name" />

      <!-- NOTE button
      buttons are the primary means of submitting the data entered by the user -->
      <button>Submit</button>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
