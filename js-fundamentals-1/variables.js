// NOTE Identifier Convention in JS

// NOTE Variable names are in camel case
let firstName;
let lastName;

// NOTE Constants are in uppercase
const PI = 3.142;

// NOTE Variable Names must be mnemonic or self descriptive

//good example
let myFirstJob = "Welcome Center Associate at Gym";
let mySecondJob = "Food Services Attendent at Restaurant";

//bad example
let job1 = "Welcome Center Associate at Gym";
let job2 = "Food Services Attendent at Restaurant";

// NOTE Do not use reserved words
let name = "Chandan";
//although the above statement works do not use it since name is a reserved word

//NOTE Names may also start with $
let $firstName = "Chandan";
